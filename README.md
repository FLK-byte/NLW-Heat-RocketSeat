# NLW-Heat-RocketSeat

# About The project: 
The objective of this project was make a real time message system.

_1 Step_:

Firstly we defined the back-end making all the treatment of infos like cadastration of messages, user and relationing them, using the following packages: express, cors, dotenv, jwt, axios, typeScript, prisma for ORM and socket.io to make the connection in real time.

_2Step_:

Now we make the front-end, putting one display for messages and one side of the website to login with GitHub's account and using GitHub's Api we get our informations about the user.   



# Some considerations:

This is a project made during NLW Heat week.

This project was really important, because increased my knowledgement about libs, ts, module css and what js can do.

And I saw what packages like socket, prisma and jwt can do.

Now i gonna isolate some packages and features to learn more about them, and understand how them work prorpely, you can wait more projects using theese features comming soon =)
