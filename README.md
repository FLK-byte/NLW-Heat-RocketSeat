# NLW-Heat-RocketSeat

Some considerations:

This is a project made during NLW Heat week.

This project was really important, because increased my knowledgement about libs, ts and what js can do.

And I saw what packages like socket, prisma and jwt can do.

Now i gonna isolate some packages and features to learn more about them, and understand how them work prorpely, you can wait more projects using theese features comming soon =)
